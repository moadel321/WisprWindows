scipy>=1.8.0
soundfile>=0.11.0
av>=10.0.0  # Required for audio decoding in faster-whisper

# Speech recognition
# --- PyTorch for CUDA 12.1 ---
# NOTE: The --index-url is CRITICAL for installing the correct CUDA-enabled build.
torch>=2.1.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121 # Updated minimum torch version for better Py3.12/CUDA12 support
torchaudio>=2.1.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121 # Match torch version
# --- END PyTorch ---
faster-whisper>=0.10.0  # Faster Whisper implementation
ctranslate2>=3.24.0  # Required by faster-whisper for CUDA 12.1+ compatibility
huggingface_hub>=0.15.0  # For downloading models (if needed by faster-whisper/ctranslate2)

# --- NVIDIA CUDA Libraries (via pip - Primarily for Linux/Docker) ---
# On Windows, these are usually less critical if the CUDA Toolkit is installed system-wide,
# but including them might help in some environments or if toolkit paths are not set.

# Voice activity detection
# Note: Silero VAD used externally is loaded via torch.hub
# onnxruntime is needed if using faster-whisper's internal VAD (vad_filter=True),
# which might be disabled in the current code configuration (check faster_whisper_model.py).
onnxruntime>=1.15.0 # Use onnxruntime-gpu>=1.15.0 if GPU acceleration for ONNX models is desired/needed

# Utilities
pyyaml>=6.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0 # Used? If not, could be removed. Check project usage.
requests>=2.28.0
Pillow>=10.0.0  # For icon generation/build script

# Testing
pytest>=7.3.1  # For unit and integration testing
